# Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

In this project we were asked to create a deep Q-learning algorithm to solve a pathfinding problem. We were also asked to defend our design by explaining the approach we took in solving this problem. We then explained how the intelligent agent works and evaluated the algorithm we designed. 

# Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
# What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists use computer programming principles to create and improve systems, software, and algorithms. In this course, I was able to create and algorithm that was able to solve a problem. 

# How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

As a computer scientist I make sure to be very thourough in my work. I make sure that I understand what the cleint wants so that I create exactly what they want. 

# What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

I have an ethical responsibility to not add personal bias into my software so that it does not exclude things that I personal dont want.
